To recreate the database using MySQL and Entity Framework Core:

_**Note**: These instructions assume that you have installed and set up your MySQL Server according to Epicodus's guidelines, as well as Entity Framework Core. For more information, see [Installing and Configuring MySQL](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql) and [Configuration for Entity Framework Core](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/database-basics-c2449db9-5bd8-4303-af8d-7ed7259f79a7/configuration-for-entity-framework-core)._

1. Open Windows PowerShell, the MacOS Terminal, or your VS Code terminal and use the command ``cd [YOUR DOWNLOAD FILEPATH]/SweetShop.Solution``.
2. Ensure that the Migrations folder is included in your cloned repository.
3. Use the ``dotnet ef database update`` command to apply the latest database migration.
